## 🚀 Overview

Retail companies generate massive volumes of transactional data daily. But data without insights is just noise. 
This project leverages Python’s data analytics stack to:

- Identify loss-making products and categories
- Understand customer and regional behavior
- Visualize trends across time, geography, and product hierarchy
- Provide actionable recommendations for increasing profitability

> 🔎 **Tool Stack:** Python • Pandas • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Jupyter


The dataset contains retail sales transactions including:

| Column          | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Order Date     | Date of customer purchase            |
| Ship Date      | Shipping fulfillment date            |
| Ship Mode      | Delivery option selected             |
| Segment        | Customer segment (Consumer, etc.)    |
| Region         | U.S. region                          |
| Category       | Product category                     |
| Sub-Category   | Product sub-type                     |
| Sales          | Revenue generated                    |
| Profit         | Net margin from sale                 |
| Discount       | % off given to customer              |

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and structure raw retail data
- Perform in-depth exploratory analysis
- Visualize trends and outliers
- Answer key business questions:
  - Which categories are most/least profitable?
  - What is the relationship between discount and profit?
  - Are certain regions consistently underperforming?

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

📉 Furniture > Tables sub-category contributes most to losses  
🟢 Technology category has highest profitability across all regions  
⚠️ High discounting (esp. > 30%) leads to negative margins  
🌍 The South region has lower average profit per sale than West or Central  
🚛 Ship mode has little correlation with profit, but affects delivery time

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes:

- Bar charts for category-wise sales/profit
- Heatmaps for feature correlation
- Line plots for monthly trends
- Boxplots for distribution comparisons
- Custom color palettes for visual clarity

> ✅ All charts are created using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for maximum flexibility.
